            - the counters need to be global values because js handles memory addressing on its own with 
            out allowing for the developer to change the value stored at a certain address passing changing 
            values from different local scopes is an issue and will not change the value itself
            - counter used instead
                - this counter limit needs to account for different width of characters - tbd - optional
                - a char map needs to be created of each char st each char wont exceed the max
                length of the text. note that standard was set for a row of a's in lowercase
                    - this could be simplified if the width of the pre tag adjusts to the 
                    length of the text in it but isnt possible in js
                    - most letters are the same width except m and w the two of which have similar sizes

side note
    - currently working on the notes page
    - add what buttons do not work or are under construction
    - for keycodes other than entering values there needs to be a function for said action
        - start with what is in commments
    - throw comments in code before functions, variable sections etc (section based)
    - for spacebar function when there is no text no space is added
        - basic functionality of strings in js (treated like null or zero)
        - easy fix
    - edit backspace to delete enters
    - issue with keyloggers is that parsing the functions changes with entry and title
        - easy refactor into one function
